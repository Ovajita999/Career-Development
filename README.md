This profile is a part of my assignments with Promineo Tecs Backend coding program. I am employed full time but I am hoping to shift my career towards software development. I will be trying to make the most of my time in the program and learn as much as I can. 

Outside of work, I enjoy many hobbies spending time outdoors with my dog or cooking
